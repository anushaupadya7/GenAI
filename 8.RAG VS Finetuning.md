# ⚡ RAG vs Fine-Tuning

This repository explains the differences between **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Fine-Tuning** for large language models (LLMs), their use cases, pros, cons, and production considerations.

---

## 1️⃣ What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

**Definition:**  
RAG is a technique where a language model is augmented with external knowledge by **retrieving relevant information** from a document database before generating a response.

**How it Works:**
1. Query → Embed → Retrieve top-K relevant chunks from a vector database.
2. Inject retrieved context into the prompt.
3. LLM generates an answer using both its knowledge and the retrieved context.

**Example Prompt:**
xt: {retrieved chunks from documents}
Question: {user query}
Answer concisely:

**Use Cases:**
- Question-answering on large corpora
- Summarization of documents
- Customer support knowledge bases
- When knowledge is frequently updated

**Pros:**
- Keeps model lightweight
- Always up-to-date (retrieves latest info)
- No retraining required
- Works well for dynamic data

**Cons:**
- Requires vector DB and retrieval infrastructure
- Latency can be higher due to retrieval
- Answer quality depends on retrieval relevance

## 2️⃣ What is Fine-Tuning?

**Definition:**  
Fine-tuning is the process of **training an LLM on a specific dataset** so that it learns domain-specific knowledge or behaves in a specific way.

**How it Works:**
1. Prepare domain-specific dataset.
2. Fine-tune pre-trained LLM on this dataset.
3. Deploy the model to serve predictions without external retrieval.

**Use Cases:**
- Domain-specific chatbots (legal, medical, finance)
- Instruction-following models
- Custom writing styles or tone

**Pros:**
- Very accurate for the specific domain
- No need for real-time retrieval
- Model can generalize better within fine-tuned domain

**Cons:**
- Expensive and time-consuming
- Hard to update knowledge (requires retraining)
- Model size increases with dataset

## 3️⃣ RAG vs Fine-Tuning: Key Differences

| Aspect                  | RAG                                  | Fine-Tuning                       |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Knowledge Source        | External documents / vector DB       | Model weights                     |
| Update Frequency        | Easy to update documents             | Requires retraining               |
| Latency                 | Slightly higher due to retrieval     | Low (direct model inference)      |
| Model Size              | Can use smaller LLM                   | Model grows with domain dataset   |
| Accuracy                | Depends on retrieval quality          | High on fine-tuned domain         |
| Cost                    | Cheaper (no retraining)               | Expensive (compute + storage)     |
| Best for                | Frequently updated knowledge bases   | Stable, domain-specific tasks     |

## 4️⃣ Production Considerations

**RAG:**
- Precompute embeddings for documents
- Use vector DBs like Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate
- Use low temperature (0–0.3) for deterministic output
- Cache common queries for performance

**Fine-Tuning:**
- Collect high-quality labeled datasets
- Monitor model drift over time
- Retrain periodically for new knowledge
- Consider smaller models for latency

## 5️⃣ When to Choose Which

| Scenario                                          | Recommended Approach |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Large, dynamic knowledge base                     | RAG                |
| Domain-specific chatbot with stable knowledge    | Fine-Tuning        |
| Need frequent updates without retraining         | RAG                |
| High accuracy in a specialized domain           | Fine-Tuning        |
| Cost-sensitive solution                           | RAG                |
| Control over model behavior and tone             | Fine-Tuning        |

---

## ⚡ Summary

- **RAG:** Flexible, dynamic, up-to-date, uses retrieval + LLM.  
- **Fine-Tuning:** Accurate, domain-specific, static, requires retraining.  
- Both approaches can also be combined: RAG + Fine-Tuned model for **best accuracy + flexibility**.
